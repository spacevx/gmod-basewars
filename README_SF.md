# BaseWars
BaseWars is a gamemode all about printing and raiding. Build your own base to print tons of money while fighting off enemies trying to raid you! By itself, this can be managed without having a lot of Lua knowledge easily but with it can also function as a framework for a developer to work upon!

## Installation

The gamemode's default config uses Customizable Weaponry 2.0, you can install the needed packs from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=349050451), [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358608166) and [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359830105).

If you don't want to use CW2.0, you can easily edit the config to add your own weapons!

### Prerequisites
* A CPPI compliant prop-protection addon.
* A fading door addon.
* CS:S needs to be mounted serverside, clients will need to have CSS mounted too, along with TF2 mounted for certain sounds.
* A working FastDL. The gamemode uses some custom content. If you don't know how to setup a FastDL server, take a look at google or refer to [this guide](https://youtu.be/0QzskhFa0L4).

### Installing the gamemode
* Drag the folder into ```garrysmod/gamemodes```.
* Edit ```garrysmod/gamemodes/basewars/gamemode/config.lua``` to your own liking.
* #### MAKE SURE you installed a CPPI compliant prop-protection addon.
